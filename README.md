# 💌 Thank You, Devs

**A heartfelt tribute to the magicians of tech.**

This space is for the developers, designers, documenters, debuggers, and dreamers  
who build the tools, fix the bugs, write the docs, and never get enough credit for it.

To the ones behind the tabs, the issues, the pull requests —  
to the open-source hearts who build the internet without applause:

Your magic makes the world move — thank you for every keystroke.

✨ Thank you. ✨

I may just be someone exploring GitHub for fun —  
but your work?  
It’s seen. It’s appreciated. It’s magical.


– Chandie 💛
